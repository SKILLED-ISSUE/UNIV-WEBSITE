                    Despite its proximity to the Main Campus in Sta. Mesa, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines
                    San Juan Campus lives up to the institution’s commitment to democratize access to educational
                    opportunities for economically challenged but deserving youths in the very heart of the National
                    Capital Region, the historic city which served as the site of the first battle of the Philippine
                    Revolution against Spain.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through the relentless effort of the City Government of San Juan under the administration of then
                    Mayor <strong>Joseph Victor “JV” G. Ejercito</strong>, who promotes the role of education in nation
                    building, the long cherished dream of the people of San Juan to establish a public college in the
                    city was brought to fruition. It started with the issuance of <strong>Memorandum Order No. JVE-C-13,
                        Series of 2007</strong> which created a special committee to study and prepare the ground works
                    for the establishment of a public tertiary academic institution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On December 13, 2007, the <strong>Sangguniang Panlungsod of San Juan</strong> issued <strong>City
                        Resolution No. 32, Series of 2007</strong> which authorized Mayor Ejercito to sign a memorandum
                    of agreement (MOA) with PUP, a state university established in 1904 and which continues to flourish
                    as a stronger institution of higher learning determined to effect change in the lives of the
                    Filipino youth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <strong>Sangguniang Panlungsod</strong> passed on January 21, 2008 <strong>City Ordinance No. 6,
                        Series of 2008</strong> otherwise known as “An Ordinance Establishing a PUP Campus in the City
                    of San Juan, Metro Manila”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The signing of the MOA by Mayor Ejercito, on behalf of the City of San Juan and former University
                    President <strong>Dr. Dante G. Guevarra</strong>, on behalf of PUP on February 20, 2008 became a
                    landmark in San Juan’s long history of struggle for quality but accessible tertiary education.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Subsequently, the <strong>PUP Board of Regents</strong> approved and ratified the MOA on March 14,
                    2008 through <strong>Board Resolution No. 613, Series of 2008</strong>. Since then and for the years
                    to come, PUP San Juan Campus has strived and will continue to strive to become <strong>Tanglaw ng
                        Bayan sa Dambana ng Kagitingan</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, PUP San Juan City Campus which started as a locally funded campus is now a viable institution
                    by virtue of <strong>Republic Act 11348 on 25 July 2019</strong> and continues to grow and develop
                    as a higher learning institution.
